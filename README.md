# DD2421-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning course lab held at KTH

Solutions of labs of the Machine Learning course held at KTH.

decision-trees: first lab, the aim is to build, measure performances and prune decison trees.
SVM: second lab, the aim is to build a support vector machines able to classifiy a two class problem. Different type of kernels were explored.
baesian-classifier: third lab, the aim is to build baesian classifiers and implement boosting by applying the Adaboost algorithm.
programming_challenge: this is the final project, worth 30% of the final grade. The aim is to build and train a classifier for a multiclass dataset.
